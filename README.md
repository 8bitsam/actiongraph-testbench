# Documentation for the ActionGraph Dataset and Benchmarks

See paper: "Representation of Inorganic Synthesis Reactions and Prediction: Graphical Framework and Datasets."

## Data Availability

The dataset used in this paper can be obtained either directly by running the code (see the "Creating Data
Sets" section). An alternative is to download it from 
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samandrello/actiongraph-inorganic-synthesis), which contains the
dataset used in the experiment.

If you download it this way, ensure the data (`json` files) are placed directly at `Data/filtered-ag-data`
(with the top-level directory being this repository).

## Running Code

### Initialization

1. Before running the scripts, first install the necessary requirements by running `pip install requirements.txt`
   while in this directory.
2. Then, you can test to see if ActionGraphs are being created correctly by running the Juptyer notebook in
   `example/`. This should convert two Materials Project synthesis reactions into
   ActionGraphs, then display the graphs.

### Creating datasets

1. Create a Materials Project account and obtain an API key [here](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api).
2. Place this key in a text file called `api-key.txt` in `utils/`
3. Run `fetch_synthesis_data.py` and then `filter_synthesis_data.py` in
   `utils/`. This will create dataset 1 (raw Materials Project data).
4. Run `convert.py` in `ag-knn-test`. This will convert the first dataset
   into serialized ActionGraphs and thus make dataset 2.
5. Ensure the datasets match by running `remover.py` in `utils/`.

### Training Models

1. To run the model on dataset 1, run the script `pipeline.py`
   in `knn-baseline/`. This will featurize the data, train, evaluate, and save
   the model.
2. To run the model on dataset 2, first find the maximum number of nodes. To
   do this, run `find_max_nodes.py` in `utils/` and update the `MAX_NODES`
   variable in `ag-knn-test/featurize.py`. Then, run `pipeline.py` in
   `ag-knn-test/`.
3. To run the PCA experiment, simply run `run_pca_experiment.py` in
   `ag-knn-test/`. This will also save relevant plots.

### Visualizing Data

The visualizations can be generated by running the `visualize_features.py`
scripts in the respective folders for each model. The feature distributions
should be identical. The results will be saved within the `Data/` directory.
